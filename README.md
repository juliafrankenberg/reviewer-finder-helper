Tool for finding reviewers in different platforms without having to input the names in all of them 

It is a simple web app, built using streamlit, that searches academic researchers and displays the links for their name searches in the platforms: 

* Google Scholar


* PubMed

* SN Insights
    * Users need to log-in to be able to use this
    * The link will take you to a list of researchers and you have to click the one you want; the researcher won't be there if they don't have a profile on SN insights, but you should be able to see their publications

* Scopus 
    * Users need to login to scopus before using it
    * If there are multiple names it will give a couple of options of combinations of first/last names
    * There is a lot of ambiguity in Scopus, so I don't think there is a point in trying to directly access the author profile (the potential author list needs to be inspected)


   Note: I haven't been able to add the SN Reviewer finder tool as this needs API/something more complex atm
